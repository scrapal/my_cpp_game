CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/maq/CLionProjects/my_cpp_game/cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/maq/CLionProjects/game_learn/cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
